FINALIZATION

- for defaults

VITE_USE_REAL_AUTOCOMPLETE=true in an .env file

Check that your vite.json configuration file is available in the load path:

    No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - /Users/teo/code/coding-challenge-jan-2026/config/vite.json

Although autocomplete CORS can be handled

- better mock api for connections and date/time handling

We can not use trainline.com API

- CORS limitations (could be overcomed by proxy server)
- JS execution API checks (difficult to hack)

Future improvements:

- showing not first fare, but cheapest in row
- animation visual tuning + fixing sort releaunch animation bug
