VITE_USE_REAL_AUTOCOMPLETE=true in an .env file

Check that your vite.json configuration file is available in the load path:

    No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - /Users/teo/code/coding-challenge-jan-2026/config/vite.json

trainline.com - public API analyses:

- we cannot use LIVE trainline API due to:
  - CORS browser limitations
  - JS execution API test

Although autocomplete CORS can be handled

future development directions

- better mock api for connections and date/time handling

make autocomplete to react on name and translatedName

- name vs. translated name on autocomplete.

- trainline autocomplete format is real, connections are non-existent

- sync names with real trainline

- sync names from, to -> departure, arrival - and overall naming

add checkbox for 'Show only direct connections (0 changeovers)' - add that fun
